# Creative Coding Template

This template is based on three.js for creative coding projects. It provides a structured environment for developing interactive 3D graphics and animations.

## Features

- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library for WebGL rendering
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **SCSS**: Enhanced CSS with variables and mixins
- **GSAP**: High-performance animation library
- **lil-gui**: Lightweight GUI for interactive controls
- **GLSL Shaders**: Custom shader support with vite-plugin-glsl

Each project includes:
- Vite configuration for development
- SCSS styling
- Utility classes for common operations
- Three.js setup with renderer, scene, and camera

## Getting Started

4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open your browser to view the project

**Note**: Use the highest numbered `three##` folder as your starting template, as higher numbers represent more evolved and feature-rich templates.
